5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
To run the solution on the browser, simply cd into a-frame and run live-server.
To run it on iPhone, we recommend the internet because a tutorial in the ReadMe would be too complex.
Refer to demo_device.MP4 and demo_device_successfuliteration.MOV to see it in action.
Also, the node_modules that we deleted for submission was originally in the cordova-app folder if you need the location to reinstall it for grading.


6. Did you implement any extra credit options? If so, which ones?
Yes, we implemented running the solution natively on the device A-Frame was designed for. 
In this case, we didn't have access to a VR headset, so we used cordova to run the solution on Aaron's iPhone, 
which was done via XCode and USB connection to an iPhone.
Watch the demo in demo_device.mp4!
