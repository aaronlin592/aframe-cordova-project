5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
To run the solution on the browser, simply cd into a-frame and run live-server.


6. Did you implement any extra credit options? If so, which ones?
Yes, we implemented running the solution natively on the device A-Frame was designed for. 
In this case, we didn't have access to a VR headset, so we used cordova to run the solution on Aaron's iPhone, 
which was done via XCode and USB connection to an iPhone.
See the demo in demo_device.mp4!
